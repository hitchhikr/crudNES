   - Code clean up.
   - Fixed a mirroring bug in mapper Bandai (16).
   - Fixed a bug with hanging window at exit.

09/08/23 - 1.0

  - Renamed to crudNES.
  - Fixed a bug which made the emulator to crash with "Astyanax".
  - The emulator is now using the name of the current ROM to create

  - Fixed a bug which made the emulator to crash with "Just Breed".
  - Fixed a bug in labels dumping function.
  - Now displaying 240 lines in PAL mode and 224 in NTSC.
  - Word accesses are now recorded and used in jump tables.
  - Fixed MMC2 mapper ("Punch Out!").
  - Absolute addressing mode wasn't recorded.
  - ROM is now directly disassembled at exit
    (output is far better than with SmartRENES).
  - Added support for mappers 118/119/220 (MMC3/MMC6).
  - All necessary files for assembling/linking with ca65/ld65 are now generated.
  - Added support for mapper 87/CNROM ("Choplifter").
  - Added support for mapper 185/No Mapper ("B-Wings").

02/15/05 - 4.0a

  - Added support for PAL games (Retrocoders - Years Behind Demo works);
  - Added support for 16-bit graphics;
  - Added shortcut keys for switching between windowed and fullscreen modes (ALT-ENTER), 
    and for pausing the emulation process (CTRL-P);
  - Full customization of display dimensions is now allowed;
  - Customized palettes can now be loaded through the emulation settings
    dialog;
  - Added two new graphic filters: Super2xSaI and SuperEagle (NOTE: you
    must have 16-bit graphics selected to make these work properly
    and have a fast computer);
  - Fixed various memory leaks;
  - Fixed a bug found in the state loader;
  - Sped up the inaccurate PPU core;
  - Improved the accurate PPU core (fixed some bugs);
  - Partial support for joypads;
  - Fixed mapper 68 (After Burner II). Should work fine now;
  - Added support for ZIP files;

01/23/05 - 3.0a

  - Optimized both PPU cores (should work *MUCH* faster);
  - Made sure that binaries don't use 100% of available CPU time when they
    really don't have to;
  - Worked on mapper NES-BTR (Batman: Return of The Joker (U)). Games using
    it should run better now;
  - Cleaned up generic IRQ functions;
  - Preliminary support for MMC5 games. Castlevania III and Laser Invasion work
    (crappily maybe?). I am glad I can finally play Castlevania III at full 
    speed on my computer (no frame skipping, wee);
  - Preliminary support for MMC2 (Mike Tyson's Punch Out);
  - Fixed APU IRQ issues. Cobra Triangle, Skate Or Die 2, and possibly others
    work well;
  - Reduced the level of binary optimization. Now you need an OKish computer
    to run most games;
  - Reduced the amount of graphics tearing under windowed mode (VSync baby);
  - Sped up the address logger by a whole lot;
  - Fixed an issue that caused Rad Racer to malfunction from time to time
    (random bug);
